<p>I am a PhD Candidate from Harvard&rsquo;s Department of Economics and Harvard Business School.</p>
<p>My current research focuses on inequality and inefficiency in housing finance. I am particularly interested in issues surrounding racial equity and social welfare in mortgage markets.</p>
<p>My fields of specialization are Finance, Real Estate, Industrial Organization, and Econometrics.</p>

<h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px;"><a href="./pdf/MortgageDiscrimination.pdf" target="blank">Do Lenders Still Discriminate? A Robust Approach for Assessing Differences in Menus</a></h3>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Paul Willen)</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">Current Version: September 2020</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(0)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_0"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_0" style="display:none;">: In the US, borrowers can choose to get lower interest rates on their mortgages by paying more discount points upfront. It is often observed that minority borrowers pay the same number of points as white borrowers controlling for the interest rate, but pay higher interest rates than white borrowers controlling for points. How can researchers tell if lenders charge minority borrowers more than observationally similar white borrowers? We show that the answer to this question involves a &#34;menu problem,&#34; and intuitively appealing metrics of lender discrimination that are widely used in the literature can lead to false positives, false negatives, and contradictory results due to the existence of unobserved hetereogeneity in menus. This menu problem extends well beyond the mortgage market, but is often under-appreciated. To address this problem, we define (i) a new, robust, test statistic for equality in menus and (ii) a new difference in menus (DIM) metric for assessing whether one group of consumers would like to switch to another groups&#39; menus, both based on pairwise dominance relationships in the data. We show how these metrics can be computed using methods from optimal transport, and devise a procedure for hypothesis testing in this class of problems based on directional differentiation. We implement our metrics on a new dataset matching 2018-2019 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data to OptimalBlue rate locks. We find that Black and Hispanic borrowers were offered worse menus in terms of rates and points by lenders compared to Non-Hispanic White borrowers for conforming mortgages. Furthermore, the difference we detect is particularly concentrated among the more creditworthy borrowers.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Kristopher Gerardi and Paul Willen)</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">Current Version: September 2020</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(1)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_1"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_1" style="display:none;">: This paper documents large differences in mortgage prepayment behavior across racial and ethnic groups in the US which have significant implications for monetary policy, inequality, and pricing.  Using a novel dataset that combines administrative data on mortgage performance with information on race and ethnicity, we show that Black and Hispanic White borrowers have significantly lower prepayment rates than Non-Hispanic White borrowers, holding income, credit score and equity constant.   This gap is on the order of 50 percent and largely reflects different sensitivities to movements in market interest rates, and was particularly pronounced during QE1.  Differences in prepayment speeds result in large disparities between White and minority borrowers in the distribution of rates paid on outstanding mortgages, which widens during periods of low mortgage rates and high refinance volumes. Between 2010 and 2014, Black borrowers were paying 30 to 45 basis points more on average than Non-Hispanic Whites despite only a small gap of around 5 basis points between the groups at the time of mortgage origination.  The large differences in prepayment behavior have important pricing implications as they suggest that minority borrowers are overpaying for their prepayment option. Our results show that inequality in mortgage markets is larger than previously realized and is exacerbated by expansionary monetary policy.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">Current Version: June 2018</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(2)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_2"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_2" style="display:none;">: I develop a new method for estimating counterfactuals in dynamic discrete choice models, a widely used set of models in economics, without requiring a distributional assumption on utility shocks. Applying my method to the canonical Rust (1987) setting, I find that the typical logit assumption on utility shocks can lead the researcher to conclude that the agent&#39;s counterfactual choice probabilities are much more sensitive to policy changes than what a semi-parametric model would suggest. Therefore, my method may be useful to applied researchers in generating policy counterfactuals that are robust to such distributional assumptions.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Rune Stenbacka and Oz Shy)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>International Journal of Industrial Organization, September 2016</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(3)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_3"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_3" style="display:none;">: We analyze the Markov Perfect Equilibria of an infinite-horizon overlapping generations model with consumer lock-in to compare the performance of history-based and uniform pricing in growing and declining markets. Under history-based pricing, firms charge higher prices to locked-in customers and lower prices to new customers. We show that a high exit rate of consumers (sufficiently declining market) constitutes a sufficient condition for history-based pricing to generate higher average prices than uniform pricing, thereby harming consumer welfare. In contrast, a high consumer entry rate (sufficiently growing market) ensures that history-based pricing intensifies competition compared with uniform pricing.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Jun Ishii)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Managerial and Decision Economics, April 2016</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(4)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_4"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_4" style="display:none;">: We analyze how CEO stock options compensation can be used as a commitment device in oligopolistic competition. We develop a two‐stage model where shareholders choose managerial compensation to commit their managers to being aggressive in equilibrium. Our results may explain why some shareholders appear to incentivize ‘excessive’ risk taking through stock options compensation. We analyze how our results are impacted by product quality, marginal cost, product differentiation, and industry concentration. As motivation for our research, we show that there exists positive empirical correlation between industry concentration and options compensation vega within a sample of firms, as suggested by our model. </span></p>
