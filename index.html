<p>I am an Associate Professor at the <a href="http://economics.harvard.edu/">Department of Economics</a> at Harvard University. I graduated from UC Berkeley with a PhD in Economics in 2014.</p>
<p>My research tries to bring insights from psychology to bear on topics in economics, particularly topics relevant to developing countries. Recent projects include studying how improving sleep affects the economic outcomes of workers in India, how the endowment effect influences consumer demand for collateralized loans in Kenya, how research findings affect the beliefs and policy choices of mayors in Brazil, and how mixing rich and poor students in schools in India affects social preferences and behaviors.</p>
<p>I am a Faculty Research Fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), and a faculty affiliate at the The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (JPAL). I serve as an Associate Editor at the <em>Journal of Political Economy</em>. Together with Frank Schilbach and Heather Schofield, I help run the <a href="https://behavioraldevlab.org/index.html">Behavioral Development Lab</a> in India.</p>

Previous findings are contradictory. We provide a potential explanation using evidence from a field experiment. In a door-to-door solicitation, men and women are equally generous, but women become less generous when it becomes easy to avoid the solicitor. Our structural estimates of the social preference parameters suggest an explanation: women are more likely to be on the margin of giving, partly because of a less dispersed distribution of altruism. We find similar results for the willingness to complete an unpaid survey: women are more likely to be on the margin of participation.

We design a field experiment to estimate a model of voting `because others will ask&#39;. The expectation of being asked motivates turnout if individuals derive pride from telling others that they voted, or feel shame from admitting that they did not vote, provided that lying is costly. In a door-to-door survey about election turnout, we experimentally vary (i) the informational content and use of a flyer pre-announcing the survey, (ii) the duration and payment for the survey, and (iii) the incentives to lie about past voting. The experimental results indicate significant social image concerns. For the 2010 Congressional election, we estimate a value of voting ‘to tell others’ of about $15, contributing 2 percentage points to turnout. Lastly, we evaluate a get-out-the-vote intervention in which we tell potential voters that we will ask if they voted.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Leonardo Bursztyn, Bruno Ferman, Stefano Fiorin and Martin Kanz)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Quarterly Journal of Economics, August 2018</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(2)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_2"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_2" style="display:none;">: This paper provides novel field-experimental evidence on status goods. We work with an Indonesian bank that markets platinum credit cards to high-income customers. In a first experiment, we show that demand for the platinum card greatly exceeds demand for a nondescript control product with identical benefits, suggesting demand for the pure status aspect of the card. Transaction data reveal that platinum cards are more likely to be used in social contexts, implying social image motivations. Combining price variation with information on the use of the card sheds light on the magnitude of the demand for social status. In a second experiment, we provide evidence of positional externalities from the consumption of these status goods.  The final experiment shows that increasing self-esteem causally reduces demand for status goods. We infer that part of the demand for status is psychological in nature, and that social image is a substitute for self image.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(3)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_3"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_3" style="display:none;">: I exploit a natural experiment in Indian schools to study how being integrated with poor students affects the social behaviors and academic outcomes of rich students. Using administrative data, lab and field experiments to measure outcomes, I find that having poor classmates makes rich students (i) more prosocial, generous and egalitarian; and (ii) less likely to discriminate against poor students, and more willing to socialize with them. These effects are driven by personal interactions between rich and poor students. In contrast, I find mixed but overall modest impacts on rich students&#39; academic achievement.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Liang Bai, Benjamin Handel and Ted Miguel)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Accepted, Review of Economics and Statistics</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(5)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_5"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_5" style="display:none;">: Self-control problems constitute a potential explanation for the under-investment in preventive health in low-income countries. Behavioral economics offers a tool to solve such problems: commitment devices. We conduct a field experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of different types of theoretically-motivated commitment contracts in increasing preventive doctor visits by hypertensive patients in rural India. Despite achieving high take-up of such contracts in some treatment arms, we find no effects on actual doctor visits or individual health outcomes. A substantial number of individuals pay for commitment but fail to follow through on the doctor visit, losing money without experiencing health benefits. We develop and structurally estimate a pre-specified model of consumer behavior under present bias with varying levels of naivete. The results are consistent with a large share of individuals being partially naive about their own self-control problems: sophisticated enough to demand some commitment, but overly optimistic about whether a given level of commitment is sufficiently strong to be effective. The results suggest that commitment devices may in practice be welfare diminishing, at least in some contexts, and serve as a cautionary tale about their role in health care.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(6)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_6"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_6" style="display:none;">: Why are people living in poverty disproportionately affected by mental illness? We review the interdisciplinary evidence of the bi-directional causal relationship between poverty and common mental illnesses -- depression and anxiety -- and the underlying mechanisms. Research shows that mental illness reduces employment and therefore income and that psychological interventions generate economic gains. Similarly, negative economic shocks cause mental illness, and anti-poverty programs such as cash transfers improve mental health. A crucial next step toward the design of effective policies is to better understand the mechanisms underlying these causal effects.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Jonas Hjort, Diana Moreira, and Juan Francisco Santini)</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">Current Version: July 2020</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Conditionally Accepted, American Economic Review</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(7)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_7"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_7" style="display:none;">: Can research findings change political leaders&#39; beliefs and cause policy change? Collaborating with the National Confederation of Municipalities in Brazil, we work with 2,150 municipalities and their mayors. We use experiments to measure mayors&#39; demand for research information and their response to learning research findings. In one experiment, we find that mayors and other municipal officials are personally willing to pay to learn the results of impact evaluations, and update their beliefs when informed of the findings. They value larger-sample studies more, while not distinguishing on average between studies conducted in rich and poor countries. In a second experiment, we find that informing mayors about research on a simple and effective policy (reminder letters for taxpayers) increases the probability that their municipality implements the policy by 10 percentage points. In sum, we provide direct evidence that policy-makers value research information, change their beliefs when presented with it, and that this can drive policy change. Information frictions may thus help explain  failures to adopt effective policies.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Revise and Resubmit, Quarterly Journal of Economics</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(8)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_8"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_8" style="display:none;">: This paper measures sleep among the urban poor in India and estimates the economic returns to increased sleep. Adults in Chennai have strikingly low quantity and quality of sleep relative to typical guidelines: despite spending 8 hours in bed, they achieve only  5.6 hours per night of sleep, with 32 awakenings per night. A three-week treatment providing information, encouragement, and sleep-related items increased sleep quantity by 27 minutes per night without improving sleep quality. Increased night sleep had no detectable effects on cognition, productivity, decision-making, or psychological and physical well-being, and led to small decreases in labor supply and thus earnings. In contrast, offering high-quality naps at the workplace increased productivity, cognition, psychological well-being, and patience. Taken together, the returns to increased night sleep are low, at least at the low-quality levels typically available in home environments in Chennai. We find suggestive evidence that higher-quality sleep improves important economic and psychological outcomes.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Stefano DellaVigna, John List and Ulrike Malmendier)</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">Current Version: June 2019</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Revise and Resubmit, American Economic Review</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(9)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_9"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_9" style="display:none;">: We design two field experiments to estimate the nature and magnitude of workers’ social preferences towards their employers. Unlike previous gift-exchange field experiments, we vary piece rates in addition to gift treatments. This piece-rate design allows us to estimate the elasticity of effort to motivation and in turn identify aspects of the workers’ social preferences. The first experiment measures productivity—units of output produced in a fixed amount of time. The second experiment measures a form of labor supply—the willingness to work for extra time. Using the piece-rate treatments, we document that productivity is rather unresponsive to motivation, while labor supply is very responsive. In terms of social preferences, we document, first, that workers provide effort for their employer, but are insensitive to the return to the employer. This result is consistent with models of ’warm glow’ or social norms, rather than pure altruism towards the employer. Second, while we do not detect any effect of the gifts in the productivity experiment, we find sizable positive impacts in the labor-supply experiment. We show that, at least in part, this different response to gifts is explained by different elasticities of productivity and labor supply, highlighting the importance of the piece-rate design.
